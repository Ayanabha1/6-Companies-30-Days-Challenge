Welcome to my #6Companies30Days challenge journey, where I am revising my Data Structures and Algorithms concepts by solving 90 problems in 30 days from renowned companies like Goldman Sachs, Amazon, and more. This GitHub repository serves as a documentation of my daily progress.

```
Each day has its own folder, and each problem is stored as a separate folder within the corresponding dayâ€™s folder. Each problem folder contains two files:  
**solution.cpp**: Contains the code solution to the problem.  
**readme.md**: Contains the handwritten solution to the problem.

## Progress Updates
I will be updating the repository daily with my progress. Stay tuned for more updates! ðŸ’»ðŸ’ª
